            <p class="title">01. Sound Characteristics and Transmission </p>
            <p>Chewing sounds are often wet, sticky, or intermittent noises, such as the "click" or "smack" sounds from
                chewing gum, biting into an apple, or eating chips. These sounds, characterized by their repetitive high
                frequencies and irregular rhythms, easily draw attention, especially in quiet environments where they
                become more intrusive. Additionally, these noises are typically transmitted at close range, such as at
                dining tables or in office spaces, amplifying their impact on listeners.</p>
            <p class="title">02. Emotional and Memory Associations </p>
            <p>Some individuals with misophonia may associate chewing sounds with negative memories or emotional
                experiences, such as violations of public etiquette or uncomfortable situations. These associations
                heighten their sensitivity to chewing sounds, leading to intense emotional reactions.</p>
            <p class="title">03. Helplessness Due to Lack of Control </p>
            <p>Misophonia sufferers are unable to control the source of the sounds, which amplifies their aversion. For
                instance, in social settings, chewing sounds are often unavoidable, leaving sufferers feeling trapped
                and experiencing emotions such as anger, anxiety, or even nausea.</p>
            <p class="title">04. Tension in Close Relationships</p>
            <p>The strong reactions of misophonia sufferers to sounds can strain their relationships with family,
                friends, or colleagues. A simple eating noise may lead to conflicts or discomfort, increasing the social
                stress experienced by those with misophonia.</p>
